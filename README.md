## General Information

This repository contains an implementation of Query-Answer Networks ([qa_network.py](./qa_network.py)). Interacting with the model
requires the construction of ContextQueries objects ([query.py](./query.py)). Additional information can be found in comments 
within these files. A minimal example can be found at the end of [qa_network.py](./qa_network.py#L531).
